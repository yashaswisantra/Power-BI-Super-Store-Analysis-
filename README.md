# Superstore Dashboard

This is a Superstore data. I did a visualization on the sales output of a Superstore by using Power BI. Here I have discussed about the total sales, total profit and total discount for different categories, segments and years.

Here are the key insights from the Superstore Dashboard:

1) Sales by Category: Technology leads with $0.84M, followed by Furniture ($0.74M) and Office Supplies ($0.72M).
2) Sales and Profit Trend: Both sales and profit show a consistent upward trend from 2016 to 2019. 2019 had the highest sales ($0.73M) and profit.
3) Customer Segments: Consumer segment is the largest, accounting for 52% of total quantity. Corporate (31%) and Home Office (18%) follow.
4) Discounts: Office Supplies category receives the highest discount (60%), followed by Furniture (21%) and Technology (18%).
5) Geographic Performance: The map indicates sales spread across multiple states. Indiana shows the highest maximum profit, followed by Washington and Delaware.
6) Year-over-Year Growth: The business shows consistent growth in both sales and profit from 2016 to 2019.
7) Category Mix: While Technology leads in sales, it receives the lowest discount percentage, potentially contributing to higher profitability.
8) State Performance: There's significant variation in profit across states, with some performing notably better than others.
